Telly, put your thumb in the air, your finger over there, look for your other thumb. You'll probably find it on the other hand. Put that thumb on the end of your finger, put that finger on the end of your thumb. You got a telly now. What program shall I put on the telly? I know. That program's called 'What's This Ear'. Put your cheek on the telly. That program's called 'Don't Be Cheeky'. Put your nose on the telly. That'd make a good program. And that program's called 'The Six O'Clock Nose'.
