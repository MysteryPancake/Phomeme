My Dad. My dad says, after the war was over, everyone came home to sort things out. There weren't going to be, any more wars. There weren't going to be, any more poor people. There weren't going to be, any more bad houses. There weren't going to be, any more people out of work. That was, forty years ago. Now they're trying to invent spaceships, that drop bombs.
