Schram and Scheddle. There's an old shop in Islington called, Schram and Scheddle. Today it's a shop that sells, preposterous presents. I imagine, that a long time ago it was a tailor shop, and it went like this. Mr. Schram, was the boss. Mr. Scheddle, sat at the sewing machine, with his foot on the pedal, sewing away. Sometimes Mr. Schram, thought Mr. Scheddle wasn't working hard enough, so he shouted, "Pedal, Scheddle!", and Scheddle snarled back, "Scram, Schram!" And so it went on, day after day, "Pedal, Scheddle!" "Scram, Schram!" "Pedal, Scheddle!" "Scram, Schram!" "Pedal, Scheddle!" "Scram, Schram!"
