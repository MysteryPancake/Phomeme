Tea Time. It's tea time, and we're sitting at the table, and my dad wants milk in his tea. "Oh, uh, could you get me the milk?" I get the milk. I sit down again. Then he wants butter for his bread. "Oh, um, could you get me the butter?" He says. I get the butter, and I sit down again. Then he wants a teaspoon for his tea. "Oh, uh, could you get me a teaspoon?" He says, and then my mum says, "Once you get that bum of yours stuck in a chair you never get it off again, do you?" And my dad says, "I can't get a moment's peace round here."
