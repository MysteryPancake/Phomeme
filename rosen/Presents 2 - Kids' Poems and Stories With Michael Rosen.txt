Presents. It was Christmas Eve. I knew father Christmas was mum and dad, I knew he didn't come down the chimney and instead, they came through the door. I knew it didn't all come out of a sack but instead they left a heap of stuff at the end of the bed, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. What I didn't know, was what was going to be in the heap. But I went to sleep. So then I woke up. Nothing. So I went to sleep. So then I woke up. Nothing. Oh, was that piece of paper there before? Must have been. So I went to sleep. So then I woke up. Nothing. And it's morning. Has father Christmas forgotten me, heh, I mean mum and dad? Get up, feeling bad, feeling worse than bad, terrible, nearly crying. That piece of paper, what is it? It's a picture of a bike, and underneath it it says, 'downstairs'. So it's, rush, rush downstairs, front room, and there it was, propped up against a chair in front of the telly, big and shining, the bike! Of course. Ha! Father Christmas couldn't stuff a bike down the chimney, could he?
