The Car Trip. Mum says, "Right you two. This is a long car journey. I'm driving, and I can't drive properly if you two are going mad, in, the back. Do you understand?" So we go "Okay mum, okay. Don't worry about it!" And off we go. And then we start, the moaning. "Can I have a drink? I want some crisps. Can I open my window? He's got my book. Get off me! That's my ear!" And mum tries to be exciting. "Look out the window! There's a lamppost!" And then we go on. "Can I have a sweet? He's sitting on me. Are we nearly there? Don't scratch! You never tell him off! Now he's biting his nails! I want a drink, I want a drink." And mum tries to be exciting again. "Look out the window! There's a tree!" And then we go on. "My hands are sticky. He's playing with the door handle now. Feel a bit sick actually. Your nose is all runny. Don't pull my hair, he's punching me mum! That's really dangerous you know! Mum, he's spitting!" And mum says, "Right, I'm stopping the car! I, am, stopping the car!" She stops the car. "Now, if you two don't stop it, I'm gonna put you out the car and leave you by the side of the road." "He started it! I didn't, he started it!" "I don't care who started it! I can't drive properly if you two, go, mad in the back. Do you understand?" And we go, "Okay mum, okay. Don't worry about it. Can I have a drink?"
