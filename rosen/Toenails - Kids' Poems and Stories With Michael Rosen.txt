Toenails. More and more people in Britain today are using, toenails. Smart and smooth, they grow on all five toes of each foot. We spoke to Jack Davis of Hackney. "Yeah, I like toenails. I've got ten of them. Big ones for the big toes, and, uh, little ones for the little toes. They're great." Be like Jack. Be smart. Grow toenails.
