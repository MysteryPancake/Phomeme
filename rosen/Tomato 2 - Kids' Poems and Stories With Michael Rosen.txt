Tomato Two, or how I learnt to love tomatoes. When I get in, if there's one thing I love, it's a fat red tomato. I love the feel of my tongue and lips on the tight skin, then I make my teeth, cut into the flesh so the, juice jumps into my mouth. The coolness, and the wetness. So now I get some pepper, and put a few grains on the flesh, so with my next bit a tasty feel starts, under my tongue. I get a piece of bread and all the wheaty mealy stuff mixes with the juicy tomato stuff, and that's the way it goes down now, bread and tomato, tomato and bread in a lovely wet, grainy, savoury, flavory, round the mouth, fruity, bready mush. Ah.
