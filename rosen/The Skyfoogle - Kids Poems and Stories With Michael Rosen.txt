The Skyfoogle. There was a man who turned up round our way once, put up a tent in the park he did, put notices all round the street saying that he was going to put on show, a terrifying creature called, the Skyfoogle. No one, had ever seen this thing before. The show was on for two o'clock the next day. Next day we all turned up to see, the fiercest, animal, in the world! The man took the money at the door. We all poured into the tent, with a curtain in front of it. We all sat down and waited. The man went off behind the curtain. Suddenly we all heard a terrible noise. There was an awful yelling and crying, there was the noise of chains rattling and someone shouting, suddenly the man came running onto the stage in front of the curtains. All his clothes were torn, there was blood on his face, and he screamed, "Quick! Get out! Get out of here! The Skyfoogle has escaped!" We all got up, and ran out the door and got away as fast as we could. By the time we got ourselves together, the man had gone! We never saw him again! None of us ever saw our money ever again either! And none of us, has ever seen, the Skyfoogle.
