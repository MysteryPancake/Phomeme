My Dad Calls Me. When I tell fibs, my dad calls me, Louie Lou Liar. When I come in from playing, with my clothes a bit mucked up he calls me, Dopey Dog Dirt. When we were in this cafe on holiday and I laughed and, coughed orange juice all over the floor, my dad called me, Gary Gob Hound. When I watch telly all Saturday morning and I get a bit dozy my dad calls me, Wally Telly Brains. When my nose is a bit runny and I can't find my hanky my dad calls me, King of the Bogeys. I call him, Nag Bag!
