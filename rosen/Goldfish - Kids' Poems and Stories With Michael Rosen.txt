Goldfish. On Monday, my dad woke me up. "Wake up, wake up!" He shouts, "Your goldfish is dead!" I rushed over to the tank. It wasn't dead. It was just one of his tricks. On Tuesday my dad woke me up. "Wake up, wake up!" He shouts, "Your goldfish is dead!" I rushed over to the tank. It wasn't dead. It was just one of his tricks. On Wednesday my dad woke me up. "Look, wake up." He says dead quietly. "Your goldfish is dead." "Ha, oh no it isn't!" I said. "Look, it is." He said. "Oh no it isn't!" I said. "Look, it really is." He said. So I got up, and there was my goldfish, stuck on its side on the top of the water, mouth open, eyes staring, tail stiff, dead in my tank. It wasn't one of his tricks.
