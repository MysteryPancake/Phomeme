Hot Air. I like it when you go to those places where they have those hot air things to dry your hands. You press the silver button, the machine starts roaring, and hot air rushes out of a silver spout. You hold your hands under it, and the water just, dries off your hand. Some of them, you can turn the spout, and make it blow your hair about. If you turn the spout round when your friends come in, they go to dry their hands, and the hot air goes whoosh! Into their face, whoosh! Warms your nose up, that does.
