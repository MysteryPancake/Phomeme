I was born on the seventh of May, I remember very well that awful day, I was in my mother, curled up tight, though I have to say it was as dark as night. Nothing to do, didn't want to breathe, I was so happy didn't want to leave. Then I hear some people give a shout "One push Mrs. Rosen and he'll be out!" I'm telling you that was a puzzle to me, I shouted out "How'd you know I'm a he?" Doctor shouted "Good lord, he can talk!" I popped out my head, said "Now watch me walk." I juked and jived, around that room, balam bam boula, balam ba diddy boom. Hip, hop, a hip hop hap, I'm giving you all, the Michael Rosen rap, rap, rap, rap. When I was one, I swam the English Channel. When I was two I ate a soapy flannel, when I was three I started getting thinner. When I was four I ate the dog's dinner. When I was five I was in a band playing drums. When I was six I ate a bag of plums. When I was seven I robbed a bank with my sister. When I was eight I became prime minister. When I was nine, I closed all the schools. When I was ten they made me, king of the fools. So that's what I am, that's what I be, with an M, with an I, with a K, with an E. That's what I am, that's what I be, Mr. Mike, Mr. Michael, Mr. Rosen, Mr. me. A hip, hop, a hip hop hap, I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.
