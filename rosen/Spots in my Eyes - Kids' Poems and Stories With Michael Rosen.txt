Spots in my Eyes. I've got spots in my eyes. Not spots you can see, they're on my side. I see them when I'm looking at you. To start with, I thought it was dirty windows. Then I thought it was, little flies in the air but it isn't, it's, spots in the eyes. I'm trying to find out, where the spots are, in my eyes. If you see me, staring at a white wall trying to make one eye, look at the other eye, that's what I'm doing. Looking, for the spots, in my eyes. Actually, I don't know what an eye is. Maybe it's a plastic ball, or it's a kind of little, round fish tank, glass outside, water inside, and the spots, are floating around, in the fish tank of my eye. I wish I could get rid of them. When people look up at the sky and say, "Look at that, ha ha, not a cloud in sight." I look up too, and there's all that, blue sky, and there, floating across that blue are, the spots.
