Tomato One. Here's me, and my mum's just given me, a tomato. And if there's one thing I can't stand it's, tomatoes. You know that, fleshy bit, the way it sticks to your teeth and you know all those, slimy little seeds, the way they, slide round your mouth, ew, I can't stand it. Anyway, my mum says, "Eat it", and I say "I don't want to." She says "Eat it" and I say "I hate tomatoes, all slimy", and she says, "Don't you talk like that. When I was a girl I had to eat whatever my mum put in front of me, do you think I could talk to my mother like that? Do you know there are some people in the world who'd give their right arm to have a tomato, to have half a tomato because they haven't had anything to eat for a whole week, I'm telling you this, if you don't eat your tomato there'll be no afters and I've made something, rather nice, I think you know what I mean. So here goes. In goes a bit of tomato. Pop. Just like I thought. First the fleshy bit, it sticks, then the slimy bits, they slide about, and when it all goes down my throat it's stick and slide all the way down, oh no this is horrible! So I start to sulk. I make my eyes go dim. I push my lips out. To make myself look all rotten. "Don't you dare sulk" she says, "I'm not having you sitting there throwing one of your tantrums. I don't have to put up with you behaving like this. All I'm asking you to do is to eat one tomato. It's taken months to grow, it's full of goodness, so stop that stupid sulking will you?" But I just sit there, in my great big sulk. I never did eat that tomato. Mind you, I never got any afters either.
