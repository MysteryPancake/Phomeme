No One In. Sometimes you come home, and there's no one in. There are no lights on, no food ready, no telly, no one laughing, no jokes, just you, on your own. That's when my brain starts doing things. You know, murderers and mad dog stuff. I'll tell you what I do. When I open the door, I shove it really hard and fast, and it bangs against the wall really loud, so if he's hiding behind the door he'll get it right on the nose. I never have got him. I tell you what did happen. The door handle made a great big hole in the wall.
