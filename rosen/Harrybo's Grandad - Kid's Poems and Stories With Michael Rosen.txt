Harrybo. Once my friend Harrybo came to school crying. We said "What's the matter, what's the matter?" And he said his granddad had died. So we didn't know what to say. Then I said, "How did he die?" And he said, "He was standing on Saint Pancras station waiting for the train and he just fell over and died." And then he started crying again. He was a nice man, Harrybo's granddad. He had a shed with tins full of screws in it. Mind you, my gran was nice too. She gave me and my brother a red shoehorn each. Maybe Harrybo's granddad gave, Harrybo a red, shoehorn. Dave said, "My hamster died as well." So everyone said "Shh!" And Dave said "I was only saying!" And I said, "My gran gave me a red shoehorn." Rodge said, "I got a pair of trainers for Christmas" and Harrybo said, "You can get ones without laces", and we all said "Yeah, no, that's right Harrybo, you can." Any other day we'd have said, "Of course you can! We know that, you fool!" But that day we said "Yeah, that's right Harrybo, yeah, no, no, you can, yeah."
