The Bump. I'm in the middle of a wrestle with my brother, and I find my face, right up close to his ear, and I see, the bump. The bump, is just next to his ear. It's all, shiny, and when you press it, it goes in, like a push button. He says it doesn't hurt, it just sits there. The bump. Mum says that when he was born it wasn't, a bump, it was, a shtickle. I said, "What's a shtickle?" And she said, "Like a little stick, sticking out of the side of his head." She said, they tied it up with a bit of cotton, and it died, until all that was left was, the bump. The little, shiny, bump.
