Tidy Your Room. They say, "Tidy your room." But I'm trying to kill a fly on the wall with a rolled up comic. Pew. They say, "I'm asking you to tidy your room", but I'm trying to kill the fly by squashing it with a chunk of plasticine. They say "I'm now telling you to tie to your room", and I'm, rolling up, little bits of plasticine. "For the last time, tidy your room!" But I'm making a line, of the rolled up bits of plasticine, along the edge of the chair. They say "Can you hear me?" I say "Yeah!" I'm now, flicking the bits of plasticine at the fly, on the wall. They say, "What have we just asked you to do?" and I say, "I don't know!"
