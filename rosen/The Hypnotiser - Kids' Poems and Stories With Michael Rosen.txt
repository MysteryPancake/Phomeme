The Hypnotizer. Once, a boy called Richard came to school and said, "I can hypnotize people." So we said "Yeah, yeah, I bet you can't." So he said "Okay, playtime." So playtime. We all went onto the playground, he said "Right! Who wants a go?" So Trevor said, "Yeah me!" So this boy, Richard, made Trevor lie down on the ground, on his back, and he took this gold ring out of his pocket and he put it very carefully, between Trevor's eyes, on the bridge of his nose. Then, Richard, took this conker out of his pocket. Was he on the end of a string, and he starts swinging the conker, to and fro in front of Trevor's eyes, and he starts up, talking in this spooky voice. "Watch the conker, watch the conker, go to sleep, go to sleep. Watch the conker, watch the conker, go to sleep, go to sleep." And it went on for ages. And we were all crowding round, dead quiet, watching, Trevor, listening to Richard going, "Go to sleep, go to sleep." "Is it working?" We said. "Is he going to sleep?" He's, hypnotized. Blimey! Suddenly, the going in bell went. Boing, boing! At that, Trevor, goes and stands up. He just, stands up! Ha! Dusts himself down, so we all crowded round him going, "Were you asleep? You, you were asleep, weren't you Trevor? Hey, were you hypnotized?" And he looks at us, all fed up and he says, "Only thing that happened was I got a rotten headache." After that, we used to go around telling people, "You see that bloke over there? Him? Richard? He's brilliant. He can, hypnotize people. He's a, Hypnotizer you know." And Richard, he'd hear us saying all this and he'd go, "Ha, ha, yeah oh come off it you lot I'm, I'm not that, you know I'm not that good at it, ha heh, heh heh, heh."
