Me and my Brother. Me and my brother, we sit up in bed, doing my dad's sayings. I go to bed first, and I'm just dozing off, and I hear a funny voice going, "Never let me see you doing that again." And it's my brother, poking his finger out just like my dad, going, "Never let me see you doing that again." And so I join in. And we're both going, "Never let me see you doing that again." So what happens, next time I get into trouble, and my dad is telling me off, and he's going, "Never let me see you doing that again." So I'm looking up at my dad and I'm going, "Sorry dad, yeah, sorry." And I suddenly catch sight of my brother's big face poking out from behind my dad, and while my dad is poking me with his finger in time with the words, "Never let me see you doing that again." Just where I can see him, and my brother is saying the words as well with his mouth without making a sound so I start laughing, and so my dad says "And it's no, laughing, matter!" Of course my brother knows that one as well and he's going with his mouth "And it's no laughing matter!" But my dad's not stupid, he knows something's going on, so he looks round, and there's my brother with his finger poking out just like my dad, and I'm standing there laughing. Oh no! And that's when we get into, really big trouble. Okay we got then, eh?
