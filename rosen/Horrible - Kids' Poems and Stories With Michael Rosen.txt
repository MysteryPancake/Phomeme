Horrible. I was starving. All I had for breakfast was one apple, and fifteen raisins. It was half past twelve and I had to get to Hemel Hempstead, so I bought a pizza, and I ran and ran and jumped on my train. As we pulled out of Houston station I began to eat. Trouble was, my pizza, was in a paper bag. One, sloppy, cheesy, pizza, with the melting cheese and tomato, stuck to the bag. So I, peeled off the paper, off my pizza but it was, slippery, and sticky, and the pizza came off in soggy lumps that I, scooped together and pushed into my mouth, um. Hmm, blob by blob. But then there were dollops of pizza, hiding in the corner of the bag, so I was, holding the bag up to my face, tipping it into my mouth. Hmm, mmm, om. I was drinking pizza and my fingers, were running, with, dribbles of tomato and mmm, uh. And slops of spicy cheese, all over my knuckles, so there I was, uh, licking up my skin but my fingers were trailing all over my chin. So off went my tongue round my face. Uh. Hunting for drips of pizza, but a bit of paper bag had got into my mouth, so I was in there trying to get it out with the finger I was licking. Oh uh. It was, uh, it was diving into the slobber in my mouth and I was, snuffling with my nose, like I was, breathing in pizza. It was then I noticed the woman opposite. She was watching me. She looked like she had never seen anything, quite so horrible, in all her life.
