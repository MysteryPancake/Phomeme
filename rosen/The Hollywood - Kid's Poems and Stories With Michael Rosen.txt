The Hollywood. We went to this cafe, and I had loads to eat. I had, cod and chips. The cod was huge, and there were hundreds of chips. Hundreds and hundreds of them, and I ate the lot. Then mum said, "Anyone want any afters?" And we look to see what there was. There was, apple pie. Don't like that. There was jam roly poly. Don't like that. And there was ice cream. I like that! There was, chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla, I was just about to say, "I'll have a strawberry ice cream" and I saw something else. It said, The Hollywood. And it was, vanilla ice cream, peaches, cream, chocolate sauce, cherries, trifle, jelly, and, strawberry ice cream. So I said, "Heh, I'll have a Hollywood." Dad said, "He won't eat it. They're huge." But mum said, "No, no. If he wants it, he can have it." Dad said, "Waste of money. He won't eat it." Mum said, "A Hollywood please." And we waited. Then, suddenly, it appeared! On its own! Right in the middle of a tray, with a little paper umbrella stuck in the top. Everyone in the cafe looked round. "What's that? Oh yeah yeah, that's The Hollywood. Oh yeah, yeah, that's The Hollywood alright." And the woman put it down, in front of me. The Hollywood, with a little paper umbrella stuck in the top. It was huge! It was taller than me! And I had this really long spoon to eat it with and now, heh, everyone was looking at me. I had to reach up, to get to the cherry on the top. Pop. Got it. Ah. In the mouth. It was lovely. Then on to the ice cream. Mmm. And the chocolate sauce, eh heh heh. Dig in. That was a, a bit rich but, okay. Heh. Dad loves ice cream and chocolate sauce, and he's watching me. But I don't give him any. Then there was some um, jelly stuff, and actually, um, that wasn't very nice. Uh, actually, um, it was horrible. And dad said, "Slowing down are you?" And mum said, "Leave him alone." Now, I was, filling my cheeks, so as not to taste it so much. My hands went hot and, people were looking at me. Then, I got to the trifle. Soggy cake, and that was even more horrible. I couldn't bear to put it in my mouth, I couldn't even put it in my cheeks. I hunch my shoulders and, plop. Spat some, on my plate. I stopped eating. Dad said, "Stopped, have you?" Mum said, "Leave him alone", I said, "I don't like it very much." Dad's hand, darted across the table. "I'll finish it!" He said. Oh yeah, you bet he said that. "I'll finish it!" He says. And mum turned to me and said, "Never mind dear. I don't suppose you'll ask for one of those again will you?" I don't suppose I will.
